I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Imperial College London, supervised by Prof. Kin Leung.
In my thesis, titled "Representation Learning for Efficient Reinforcement Learning", I explored how representation learning methods could improve both single- and multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms.

The resulting publications can be found [here](/research/).
